Nested loops are loops that are placed inside of another loop. They are commonly used when you need to perform a task repeatedly for each item in a list or array. You can use nested loops by placing one loop inside the body of another loop.

A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. It allows you to write reusable code that can be called from other parts of your program. To use a function, you need to define it first, and then call it from your program where you need it.

The declaration of a function tells the compiler the function's name, return type, and the type of its parameters. The definition of a function provides the actual implementation of the function's code.

A prototype is a declaration of a function that specifies its name, return type, and the type of its parameters. It is typically placed at the beginning of a program or in a header file to allow other parts of the program to use the function before it is defined.

The scope of a variable determines where in your program it can be accessed. Variables can have local or global scope, which means they can either be accessed only within a certain block of code or throughout the entire program.

The gcc flags -Wall, -Werror, -pedantic, -Wextra, and -std=gnu89 are compiler options for gcc. -Wall enables all warning messages, -Werror treats warnings as errors, -pedantic enforces strict standards compliance, -Wextra enables extra warning messages, and -std=gnu89 sets the C language standard to gnu89.

Header files are files that contain declarations for functions, variables, and constants that can be used by other parts of a program. To use a header file, you include it in your program using the #include preprocessor directive, which tells the compiler to read the contents of the file and make its declarations available
