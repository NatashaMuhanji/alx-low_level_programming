In C, variadic functions are those that accept a variable number of arguments at runtime. The stdarg.h library provides macros to access the variable argument list. The basic syntax for a variadic function involves defining the function with an ellipsis (...) that indicates the function can take a variable number of arguments, a va_list type variable that holds the variable argument list, and macros such as va_start, va_arg, and va_end that are used to initialize, access and cleanup the variable argument list. Variadic functions provide a convenient way to handle a variable number of arguments in a function, and examples of variadic functions include printf and scanf.
