## Makefiles

### General

- `make` and `makefiles` are essential tools in software development, aiding in automating the build process.
- A Makefile is a script containing rules for compiling source code into executable programs.
- These rules specify dependencies between files and commands to execute for building targets.
- We use Makefiles when managing projects with multiple source files and complex dependencies, enabling efficient compilation and linking.
- Rules define how to build targets, such as compiling source files or linking object files.
- Explicit rules explicitly specify dependencies and commands for building targets, while implicit rules automatically infer commands based on file extensions.
- Common and useful rules include compiling C or C++ source files into object files and linking them into executable program.

- Additionally, variables in Makefiles allow us to define reusable values, such as compiler flags or file names, enhancing flexibility and maintainability in build scripts.
