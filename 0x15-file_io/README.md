In C, file_io refers to the process of performing input and output operations on files. It involves opening, reading, writing, and closing files using the functions provided by the standard input/output library (stdio.h). File_io allows you to manipulate files, such as creating new files, reading data from files, writing data to files, and modifying existing files. It is an essential concept in C programming for handling data persistence and interacting with external files.
