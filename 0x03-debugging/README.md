Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing errors or bugs in computer programs, and some methods of manual debugging include adding print statements, stepping through code with a debugger, and reviewing code logic, while reading error messages involves examining the type and location of the error, understanding the error message's description and suggested resolution, and tracing back the error to its source code.
