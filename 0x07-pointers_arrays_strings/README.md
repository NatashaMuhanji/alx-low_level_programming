With arrays in C, it is possible to create multidimensional arrays, which are essentially arrays of arrays. C also provides syntax for initializing arrays at the time of declaration.

Pointers in C are often used to implement complex data structures, such as linked lists, trees, and graphs. C also provides ways to work with pointer arrays and pointer-to-functions.

Strings in C can be manipulated using a variety of string functions, such as strlen, strcpy, strcat, and strcmp. It is also possible to create custom string functions to handle specific use cases.

Understanding the memory layout of a program can also involve understanding the role of the program counter, the stack pointer, and other low-level details of the CPU and operating system. Additionally, modern C compilers often perform optimizations that can affect the memory layout of a program.
