Arrays in C are zero-indexed, which means that the first element of an array is accessed using the index 0. The last element of an array with n elements is accessed using the index n-1.

Pointers in C can be manipulated using pointer arithmetic, which allows the value of a pointer to be incremented or decremented based on the size of the data type it is pointing to. For example, incrementing a pointer to an integer (int) by 1 will add the size of an integer (typically 4 bytes) to the pointer's value.

Strings in C are commonly used to represent text, and are often used in I/O operations and text processing. Since strings are represented as arrays of characters, C provides functions to work with them as character arrays.

Understanding the memory layout of a program is important for writing efficient and safe code in C. For example, accessing memory outside of the bounds of an array can lead to undefined behavior, and accessing memory that has already been freed can lead to a segmentation fault or other memory-related errors. By understanding how memory is allocated and managed in a program, developers can write more efficient and secure code.
