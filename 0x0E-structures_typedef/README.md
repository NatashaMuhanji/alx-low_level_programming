Structures in C are user-defined data types that allow the grouping of related data items under a single name, while typedef is a keyword that is used to create aliases or alternative names for existing data types or structures, which can improve code readability and maintainability.

Structures define a collection of variables that can be accessed by their names and can be passed to functions by value or by reference. They provide a convenient way to store and manipulate complex data structures.

Typedef, on the other hand, is used to create new names for existing data types or structures, which can make code more readable and easier to maintain. It is often used to define custom data types, such as function pointers, and to make the code more portable across different platforms.
