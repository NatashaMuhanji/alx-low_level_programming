ype stored in contiguous memory locations. Arrays provide a way to store and access multiple values of the same type using a single variable name. In C, arrays are declared using square brackets [] and the number of elements in the array must be specified.

C - Pointers: In C, a pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Pointers provide a way to indirectly access and modify the value of a variable. In C, pointers are declared using the * operator. Pointers are widely used in C for dynamic memory allocation, passing parameters to functions by reference, and building complex data structures.

C - Strings: In C, a string is a sequence of characters stored in consecutive memory locations, terminated by the null character \0. Strings are represented as arrays of characters. C does not have a built-in string data type, but provides a library of functions for working with strings, including functions for concatenation, copying, and comparison.

Memory Layout: In C, the memory layout of a program is important for understanding how variables, arrays, and pointers are stored in memory. The memory of a program is divided into several regions, including the code segment, the data segment, the heap, and the stack. The code segment stores the program instructions, the data segment stores global and static variables, the heap stores dynamically allocated memory, and the stack stores local variables and function call frames. Understanding the memory layout of a program is important for optimizing memory usage and avoiding memory-related errors
